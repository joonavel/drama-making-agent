# Objectives
1.  **Visualize the Narrative:** Create a consistent visual flow based on the provided [Story Bible], [Character Bible], and [Style Bible].
2.  **Structure the Timeline:**
    -   **Keyframe 0 (0s):** Start of Shot 1.
    -   **Keyframe 1 (8s):** End of Shot 1 / Start of Shot 2.
    -   **Keyframe 2 (16s):** End of Shot 2 / Start of Shot 3.
    -   **Keyframe 3 (24s):** End of Shot 3 / Start of Shot 4.
    -   **Keyframe 4 (32s):** End of Shot 4.
3.  **Define Action:** Describe exactly what happens *between* these keyframes (Camera movement, Character acting).

# Inputs
-   **Story Bible:** Plot and Tone.
-   **Character Bible:** Visual features (Must be consistent in every description).
-   **Style Bible:** Lighting, Color Palette, Composition rules.

# Instructions for Output Generation

## 1. Keyframes (List of 5 items)
For each keyframe (moments t=0, 8, 16, 24, 32), provide:
-   **Visual Description:** A detailed, natural language description of the scene. Focus on **Subject** (Character + Outfit), **Background**, **Lighting**, and **Composition**.
    -   *Constraint:* You MUST repeat the character's fixed visual elements (e.g., "wearing a red hoodie", "scar on left cheek") in EVERY keyframe description to ensure consistency.
-   **Mood:** The emotional atmosphere of this specific moment.

## 2. Shots (List of 4 items)
For each shot interval:
-   **Camera Movement:** ...
-   **Character Action:** ...
-   **Dialogue (CRITICAL):**
    -   If the character speaks, provide the exact **Text**.
    -   Provide **Acting Instructions** (e.g., "Screaming in terror," "Whispering seductively").
    -   *Note:* This information will be used by the Video Agent to generate lip-sync compatible visuals.

# Constraints
-   **NO Technical Prompts:** Do not use tags like "--v 6.0", "4k", or specific model syntax. Use pure descriptive English.
-   **Consistency:** The "End Keyframe" of Shot N is logically the "Start Keyframe" of Shot N+1. Ensure the visual flow is seamless.
